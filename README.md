Prints escape sequences for unicode graphemes

It seems like every other day I'm looking up what the escape sequence for a
unicode grapheme is in various web languages. And I'm also trying to learn Rust.
So I wrote a tool in Rust.

**This is the root of a monorepo that contains two projects:**

- [Web app implemented with web assesmbly](./how_do_i_escape_web/README.md) (see https://how-do-i-escape.surge.sh)
- [CLI tool implemented in Rust](./how_do_i_escape_cli/README.md)
